# Work Yield Dashboard

A web-based decentralized application (dApp) for interacting with the WorkYield Token V2 smart contract. This dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for both regular token holders and contract administrators.

## üß† Core Concept

The **WorkYield Token (WYT)** is a digital asset whose supply and value are linked to productive, real-world projects, represented as **"Work Orders"** on the blockchain.

- **Work Orders**: An administrator can create a Work Order to represent a project expected to generate future revenue. When a Work Order is created, WYT tokens are minted against it.
- **Stablecoin Backing**: Users purchase WYT using a stablecoin (e.g., `pUSD`), which helps fund Work Orders.
- **Yield Generation**: As real-world projects complete and generate revenue, funds are paid back on-chain, backing the value of WYT and enabling redemptions.

> This creates a transparent, on-chain system where token value is tied to the successful completion of tangible work.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Architecture)

1. **Interface (`index.html`, `style.css`)**
   - Renders the UI and layout for the dApp.

2. **Logic (`script.js`)**
   - Connects to wallet via `ethers.js`
   - Fetches real-time data like `availableTokens()` and `workOrders()`
   - Sends transactions for buy/mint/fund/redeem/cancel

3. **Smart Contract**
   - Deployed WorkYieldTokenV2 contract handles logic, minting, fee distribution, and redemption.
